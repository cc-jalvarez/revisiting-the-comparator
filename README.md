# revisiting-the-comparator

This is the repository for the working paper *Mutatis Mutandis: Revisiting the Comparator in Discrimination Testing*. 

We use both R and Python. For implementing the experiments in Section 4, use the law school dataset in data/. The scripts are in src/. Before running the discrimination tools via run_exp_, first create the counterfactual dataset via gen_cf_, which is stored in data/. In any case, we already provide both datasets. Use analysis_ for obtaining the figures. Under the current setup, the RStan models are not required.
